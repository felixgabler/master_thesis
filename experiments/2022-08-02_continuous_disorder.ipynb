    "\n",
    "The performance for all models was way below the papers reported scores (around 0.55 spearman and 0.7 AUROC). This could be due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data distributions of train and val sets are too dissimilar => New random sets (`chezod_cnn_random_shuffle_data.out`). Result: Improved it to 0.64 spearman and 0.86 AUROC\n",
    "- Half-precision could be at fault => Try full precision (`chezod_cnn_full_precision.out`). Result: Did not improve it\n",
    "- Combine: Full precision and random data without DP (`chezod_cnn_random_full_precision.out`). Result: Same as with random data but half-precision\n",
    "- Different metric computation => Run their SETH implementation over our val set. Result: Indeed, we were calculating it incorrectly. The padded values (999) should be excluded and for AUROC, a perfect match should not count as 0 but as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running SETH on Colab over our validation sets gave the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Val Set 1\n",
    "   - Mean Masked AUROC: 0.876\n",
    "   - Mean Masked Spearman: 0.558\n",
